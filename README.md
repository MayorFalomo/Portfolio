# My Portfolio

The inspiration behind my portfolio was based off a project i built, Orpheus, The blend of colours caught my eye and i decided i wanted my portfolio that colour.

The preload flying animation at the beginning is fitting for what i coined myself, Web Wizard, So it's reminiscent of a wizard flying or a flying superhero wizard if you will.

Long time ago i saw someone's portfolio once and it had particle Js at the hro i decided i wanted something like that on my portfolio

The parallax scroll was something i adopted because i'm such a big fan of parallax scrolling, Though it was such a pain to do, being my first experience with it but all in love i love the results.

## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

I had to refactor the project section as it was making the portfolio loading slow on mobile, Removed framer-motion as that was affecting the speed and i used AOS for the transition instead. 

Made the images background images instead of using images, then i also removed the text on the project section and made it display on hover of the project picture, so in case the project pictures hasn't loaded it's blank instead of hovering text, makes for better Ux too.
