# My Portfolio

The inspiration behind my portfolio theme was based off a project i built, Orpheus.

Most of my projects are usually self inspired or front-end challenges.

## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

I had to refactor the project section the portfolio loading slow on mobile, Removed framer-motion as that was affecting the speed and i used AOS for the transition instead.
